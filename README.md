- 👋 Hi, I’m @tcrum06
- 👀 I’m interested in application development(all platforms), web design, and possibly game development at some point in the future.
- 🌱 Currently, I am working towards finishing a Bachelor's of Applied Technology in Software Engineering and am working full time as a C#/ASP.NET Core developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C#, Java, Python, and/or JavaScript projects.
