- 👋 Hi, I’m @tcrum06
- 👀 I’m interested in application development(all platforms), web design, and possibly game development at some point in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, SQL, and JavaScript as far as languages go. I am a student, so in the near future I will be starting on Python and ASP.NET that I am aware of. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java and/or JavaScript projects.
- 📫 You can reach me on discord @Joker#0048 or by email at timcrum06@gmail.com
